<p>I am more interesed in solving maths question.I like solving harder maths problems.It feels much pleasurable when i discover a creative way to solve problems.To dive into the beauty of Maths,we need to practice a lot.I am greatly inspired with our ancient indian mathematician like Aaryabhatt,Bhaskaracharya etc.I am mostly influenced with Ramanujan.</P>

I love my closer friends formed during my school time and coaching during preparation of JEE.I like chatting with them on whatsapp and facebook to get real bliss.The person whom i like the most is my dear mother.What i have achieved till now is all dedicated to her painstaking devotion in nurturing me and my sister.
